|gh copilot | Loop with enumerate() | enumerate is not needed | Decided not to use enumerate as it is not needed for reading CSV files |
| ChatGPT | how do i make a key in python to check for duplicates when names have different capital letters and the birth date looks different sometimes | Guidance to normalize text (`strip().lower()`), normalize NOC/sex to upper, and parse DOB into a consistent `dd-Mon-YYYY`. Suggested composite key `(name_lower, NOC_upper, SEX_upper, dob_norm, birth_year)` | I designed the dedupe key for `combine_paris_athletes` using exactly that shape, which prevented duplicates from name-casing and DOB format drift. |
| ChatGPT | if i got dates in different formats how can i try them all and not crash if it dont work | Suggested a `try/except` loop over a list of formats and return a default (`""`) on failure. Also suggested returning both normalized date and extracted year. | I wrote `normalize_born()` and used it inside `combine_paris_athletes`. If parsing fails, I still produce a stable key using `birth_year=""` |
| ChatGPT | whats the easy way to print like first 3 rows from my csv so i can see if its right | Recommended a tiny `dbg(*args)` print helper and a rule: print `(len, header, first 2–3 rows)` after each major step. | I added `dbg()` and printed shapes for Paris/main CSVs. Thats how I noticed Paris uses `birth_date`/`gender` vs main `born`/`sex` |
| ChatGPT | my csv has sex in one file but gender in another, and born vs birth_date, how do i find the right col without hard coding it. | Technique: lower-case a copy of the header and search for any of a list of aliases | I wrote a tiny “column resolver” in `combine_paris_athletes` and `combine_paris_events` so I don’t hard-fail on header variations |
| ChatGPT | why does python say UnboundLocalError when i try to print a var inside my function? | Explanation: the variable isnt assigned on some paths; print after assignment, or guard with `if 'name' in locals():` | I moved prints to after `clean_data()` returns and removed risky early returns that left vars undefined |
| ChatGPT | i got NameError for my debug function, how do i fix that | Answer: defined after use or shadowed. Define `dbg` near the top of the file; avoid conditional definitions. | I placed `def dbg(*a): print(*a)` right under imports. NameError gone |
| ChatGPT | if i add stuff to a list in python is append fast or slow? | Yes, amortized O(1). Watch out for aliasing a sliced view—always append to the main list reference you intend to write | I verified I was appending to `existing_bio_rows`, then writing that variable to `new_olympic_athlete_bio.csv`. |
| ChatGPT | whats the order to run my functions so paris athletes and events actually get into the file? | Recommended order and why: build the `id_map` before event merge; compute age after Games dates + DOBs are normalized | I rewired `main()` to: clean to `combine_paris_athletes` (get `id_map`) to `combine_paris_events` to rebuild lookup to re-clean DOBs (optional) to `populate_age_column` to write files |
| ChatGPT | how do i check fast if something is already in a dict values without looping | Build a side set of the dicts values for O(1) membership checks. | In `combine_paris_events`, I prebuilt `rev_values = set(paris_to_merged_athlete_id.values())` for the fallback case |
| ChatGPT | my parse_competition_date function crashes if theres no dash or the text is None, how do i stop that? | Normalize with `(text or "").strip()`, check the en-dash is present, split once, guard both sides, wrap conversions in try/except, else return empty strings. | I hardened `parse_competition_date`. This stopped crashes on odd rows and left fields blank when parsing wasnt possible. |
| ChatGPT | if a value might be None how do i strip and lower without error | Use `(value or "").strip().lower()` | I used that in `cleaning_olympic_dates` and the Paris merging functions to avoid `AttributeError`. |
| ChatGPT | how do i figure out age in python when i got a start date, end date, and birthday, and also leap year birthdays? | Age at start = usual year diff with month/day comparison, if birthday is between start and end inclusive, add +1; for Feb-29 birthdays in non-leap years, use Feb-28 | I implemented that logic in `populate_age_column` with guards and a Feb-29 fallback. |
| ChatGPT | why does my sort put 100 before 20, how do i sort numbers when theyre strings? | Convert inside the key: `key=lambda x: int(x[1])`, with try/except if needed. | I sorted medal tally by `edition_id` numerically |
| ChatGPT | in cleaning_olympic_dates how do i check if competition_date is dash or says not held due to war but sometimes caps are diff | Normalize to lower, detect dash variants, clear fields accordingly, do not crash if competition_date is empty. | I updated `cleaning_olympic_dates` to use `comp_lower = (val or "").strip().lower()` and branch safely. |
| ChatGPT | how do i know if my paris rows got added for real? | Print counts before/after, print first new 3 IDs added, and for events print the number of 2024 rows added. | I added prints for: bio count delta, matched vs added, and event rows after merging. This confirmed it worked. |
| ChatGPT | i added stuff to my list but my output csv didnt change, why? | Writing the wrong variable, reassigning to a local temp, or an early return path. | I found a typo (`clean_athlete_bio` vs `clean_bio`) and fixed it so the correct list got written. |
| Google | python list index() error if not found | `list.index(x)` raises `ValueError` if not found. For headers, check membership or use a safe resolver with try/except | I avoided `index()` directly on unknown Paris headers; I wrote a safer resolver that tries multiple aliases |
| Google | python dict set lookup speed | Average O(1), worst O(n) under heavy collisions (rare) | I used this to justify design choices in my runtime section |
| YouTube | how to debug csv in python fast? | Tips: `encoding="utf-8-sig", newline=""`, and always print header & a couple rows | I kept `utf-8-sig/newline` in `write_csv_file` and printed preview rows to validate |
| ChatGPT | how do i make a key to stop duplicate event rows when adding paris medals? | Suggested `(edition, edition_id, athlete_id, event.lower(), medal.lower())` saved in a `seen_keys` set. | I implemented exactly that in `combine_paris_events`, duplicates stopped. |
| ChatGPT | how can i check if my id_map is not empty and has real paris ids | Print `len(id_map)`, print 3 sample pairs, and verify those athlete IDs exist in the new bio rows | I added those prints, it proved the athlete merge step worked before event merging |
| ChatGPT | git how to move my changes from branch to main? | `git checkout main && git pull`, `git checkout <branch> && git rebase main` (or merge), `git checkout main && git merge <branch> && git push` | I used that to land my changes after testing on a feature branch |
| ChatGPT | python check if birthday is between two dates? | Use `start <= birthday_this_year <= end`. Handle invalid Feb-29 by mapping to Feb-28 in non-leap years. | I copied that pattern into `populate_age_column` |
|Perplexity | when calculating age how do we handle athletes with missing DOB or missing competition date | Explained that in such cases we skip age calculation to avoid wrong values and leave the column blank | Added guards in code to skip calculation when data is missing. |
|Perplexity | for column lookups and key creation why is it important to normalize cases and formats | Explained that normalizing to lower/upper case and standard date format avoids mismatches due to inconsistent input formatting | Kept normalization steps and added note in docstring. |
|Perplexity | what does str(next_id) do in Python | Explained that str() converts the integer next_id into a string, which is needed when writing to CSV or concatenating with text. | Kept conversion but noted in code comment why its needed for CSV writing. |
|Perplexity | why do we need try and except in get_max_athlete_id function | Explained that try/except is used to handle cases where the athlete_id field might be missing, empty, or not convertible to int, so the loop continues without crashing | Kept try/except to skip problematic rows but added a comment in code for clarity |
|Perplexity | how to handle athletes with multiple competition years when calculating earliest DOB | create_athlete_edition_lookup | Explained that we track the earliest competition year for each athlete and use that for century inference. |
|Perplexity | how to make sure birth date is stored in consistent dd-Mon-YYYY format | It explained to use datetime.strptime() to read the date and strftime() to write it back in the exact format I want. That way, even if the source file has different styles, my output is consistent | Kept parsing+formatting with datetime. |
|Perplexity | why is len(athlete_bio_data) - 1 used for dictionary value | It explained that since we add the new athlete to the very end of the list, the last index is len(list) - 1, so that’s how we know where they are in the list. | Kept logic but added comment in code. |
|Perplexity | how to check if string contains dash or phrase ignoring case | It said just make everything lowercase and use in to check, so "–" or a phrase is found even if the casing is weird | Added .lower() before checking. |

|AI tool name|prompt | result | alterations |
|---|---|---|---|
| Googled this prompt, used the website: Geeks for Geeks  | creating a file path in python for folder structure |  Learned about file paths and how to properly represent sub folders when opening the paris data. This was done through the use of the os module, which allowed me to interact with the operating system.   |  Used the method provided in the website: os.path.join() |
| Claude AI  | If I have a 2d list, like ``countries = ['code', 'country'], ['AFG', 'Afghanistan']``, etc and decide to use ``countries.sort()``, how can I make sure when sorting a value, that it'll sort the second value in each row. | Helped me understand creating an anonymous function that'll take a row and sort it by the second value in the row (Country)   |  Modified the lambda to handle empty rows and also added a .lower() check to ensure smooth comparisons |
|  Claude AI | I'm trying to sort my rows of data by edition_id (ascending), I've tried with my following sort method but it's not working: ``csv_data[1:].sort(key=lambda x: x[1] if len(x) > 1 else '')``   | Told me to try using pandas or to try sorted() which didn't work as well.   | Ended up scrapping the whole idea and instead sorted before adding the headers to the front of the list. |
|  ChatGPT | I need to get the highest value in a 2d list, what's the best way of doing so?  |  ``max()`` method was provided  |  I had an error right away which was a TypeError,so I modified it by casting edition_id as an int and added a for loop to go through each sublist  |
| Googled this prompt, used the website: w3 Schools  | What are the different ways to access values in a python dictionary | Read about ```.get()``` which I used in my ```add_age_to_event_results()``` function and learned about using the square brackets ```[]```, which again was used multiple times, more notably in ```merge_paris_athlete_bio()```. Also learned the method ```.keys()``` | Used ```.get()``` and square brackets ```[]```, but not the ```.keys()``` method. |
| Claude AI  | python formatting a string to a date | Showed me the use of the datetime module and the method strftime()   |  For the most part I used what was given, but I changed it to the desired format and I also imported the datetime class after reading up on it through w3schools  |
| Claude AI  | Using my datetime object, how can I convert it back to a string and changes its format? | Was given the ```.strftime()``` method  | Used what was given, however, I added the format I required ```.strftime("%d-%b-%Y")``` |
| Googled this prompt, used the website: Real Python| What's the modern way to format strings in Python? | Was shown how to use formatted string literals ``f""`` | Used the formatted string literals to set the competition_date which required date ranges with a "to" in the middle |
| Claude AI | In Python, how can I ensure that each letter of a name(string) is capitalized   | Given the method ```.capitalize()``` | Used what was given, just added it in a for loop to capitalize multiple last names if required. |
